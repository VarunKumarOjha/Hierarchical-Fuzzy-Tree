# Hierarchical-Fuzzy-Tree
The Hierachical Fuzzy Inference Tree Software Toolbox is a function approximation and feature selection tool that uses genetic programming for constructing tree like structure to construct an adaptive multi-layer perceptron. This standalone software toolbox solves prediction problems. The developed algorithm performs multiobjective in which it adaptively creates a simple models with high generalization ability.
